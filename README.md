# advent-of-code

Attempting to track my PHP*/JS (for 2023) code for Advent of Code https://adventofcode.com/

Files are named using two digits for the date and then with optional a/b if they are solving the first or second part, eg `08a.php`

Text files of the input need to be in the same directory and named in the same format, eg `08.txt`

\* it's possible code might be in Javascript, or in some cases no code at all as I've done it in Excel
