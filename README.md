# advent-of-code

Attempting to track my Python* (for 2025) code for Advent of Code https://adventofcode.com/

Files are named using two digits for the date and then with optional a/b if they are solving the first or second part, eg `08-a.php`

Text files of the input need to be in the same directory and named in the same format, eg `08-input.txt`

\* it's possible code might be in PHP, Javascript, or in some cases no code at all as I've done it in Excel
